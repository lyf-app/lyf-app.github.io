                                At lyf, we have built a social media platform for people all over the world to share their personal beats. Personal beats are inherently private and so, from our very inception, protecting privacy has been a core value. Lyf is designed to foster confidence
                                that when you create a personal beat, your beat remains just that: personal. Like anything in your personal life, you choose what you share and with whom you want to share. Maybe you want to share it with a few close friends
                                or family on a private beat? Or maybe you’re happy to share it with the whole world on a public beat? Alternatively, you may share your beat as an anonymous user. At the end of the day, for every beat you make, you are
                                in complete control.
                            </p>
                            <p>When it comes to privacy and the management of your personal information, please be assured, on the lyf platform:</p>
                            <ul class="disc-list">
                                <li>You maintain control over the disclosure of your personal information.</li>
                                <li>We won’t give your personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes</li>
                                <li>We will not share your personal information with anyone except as disclosed in this policy.</li>
                                <li>We treat your personal information with the highest regard to privacy and security.</li>

                            <p><strong>1.</strong> Lyf is a social media platform dedicated to enriching the lives of its members. At lyf’s heart is the creation of individual member accounts through which members are able to maintain their own personal
                                beats.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>2.</strong> Lyf is built around all the personal beats individuals are making in their life, and all the personal beats individuals are following. Beats can be private or public. Although lyf collects personal information
                                through the general operation of your account only our members have the ability to share their personal information.</p>
                            <p><strong>3.</strong> Through your privacy settings, Lyf enables you to easily control and manage your privacy by setting limits on the extent to which your beats are shared.</p>
                            <p><strong>4.</strong> Building trust with our members is critical to lyf. Accordingly, we will only use your personal information in accordance with this Policy and our Terms of Service.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="terms-txt">
                            <h3 id="starting-p">Starting your beat on lyf</h3>
                            <p><strong>5.</strong> To create your lyf account minimal personal information is collected. You will also be asked to create a password. </p>
                            <p><strong>6.</strong> By creating a lyf account you will have complete control over the protection of your personal information. Other members will only be able to view your personal beat when you specifically elect to invite
                                them to follow your beat. There is no requirement to make your beats public. You can have some private beats, some anonymous and some public beats.</p>
                            <p><strong>7.</strong> When you commence posting details of your private beats on lyf only a limited amount of information will be shared to the people you decide to invite to follow you – e.g. the title of your beat. If they
                                accept your invitation, they will then see all the details you post on your private beats. If you no longer wish to share your private beat with your chosen followers, you may remove them as followers at any time.</p>
                            <p><strong>8.</strong> By making a beat public, you acknowledge that you are immediately opening the information you post on that beat to the public. This means that anyone with an internet connection could potentially see all
                                of the posts you make on your public beat.</p>
                            <p><strong>9.</strong> By creating your account and commencing your first beat on lyf you expressly and voluntarily accept the <a href="terms.html">Terms of Service</a>, including the terms of this Policy.</p>

                            <p><strong>10.</strong> The policy applies to all personal information which we collect hold or use from and relating to you. For example, we collect certain details from you when you first register and create your lyf account.</p>
                            <p><strong>11.</strong> We also collect the personal information which you tell us and which you share as part of your content on your shared beats. In some cases, with your consent (for example, if you engage us to provide our
                                Lyf Support<sup>™</sup> services), we may also collect health information about you, such as your medical history. </p>
                            <p><strong>12.</strong> If you want to share a story about another person’s experiences of health related issues in which that person will be easily identifiable, you must seek permission from the individual or next of kin first
                                and let them know about our Policy. Some people may not want their experience made public. It is important to consider the impact and respect the wishes of others affected by the same story as you.</p>

                                in the ordinary course of your use of lyf.</p>
                            <p><strong>14.</strong> Lyf also collects any health information that you elect to share with our counsellors as part of any Lyf Support services that you may elect to receive.</p>
                            <p><strong>15.</strong> Collection of your personal information is necessary for us to provide you with the full range of lyf’s services.</p>
                            <p><strong>16.</strong> In particular, we collect your information from you to:</p>
                            <p><strong>a.</strong> establish your lyf account</p>
                            <p><strong>b.</strong> develop a history of the beat types (tags) you are making and the beat types (tags) you are following. We do this to help us suggest beats you may be interested in following.</p>
                            <p><strong>c.</strong> receive and respond to communications from you regarding your lyf experiences – including details of any complaints or customer support enquiries</p>
                            <p><strong>d.</strong> provide Lyf Support services</p>
                            <p><strong>e.</strong> maintain our business relationship with you and offer our services on an on-going basis</p>
                            <p><strong>17.</strong> We may also use your information for in-house research and analysis. This helps us, for example, to: (i) improve our understanding of customer needs; and (ii) support strategic development.</p>
                            <p><strong>18.</strong> Lyf or its undertaking may be the subject of sale or negotiations for sale in which case your personal information may be disclosed and ultimately pass into the custody of a purchaser. If this occurs disclosure
                                and transfer will be subject to the terms of this Policy and the Australian Privacy Principles.</p>

                                be able to moderate the data that others post about you on your beat.</p>
                            <p><strong>20.</strong> Personal information is generally collected during the course of our contact with you and is largely provided by you, first as part of your registration to become a lyf member and then on ongoing basis
                                as you create and make your own lyf beats and/or take advantage of our Lyf Support service.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong21.</strong> We also collect content and information that other people provide when they use our Services, including information about you.</p>
                            <p><strong>22.</strong>We may also request:</p>
                            <p><strong>a.</strong> your preferences for receiving further information about our services or activities</p>

                            <p><strong>32.</strong> When you elect to make a beat public then, and only then, will other members be able to search lyf to identify your public beats. By keeping your beats private you ensure other members who you haven’t invited

                            <p><strong>33.</strong> We may also use the personal information shared within the content of your beats to identify the potential of offering you access to our Lyf Support services. This does not represent a commitment on the
                                part of Lyf to be reviewing and assessing the content on your beats.</p>
                            <p><strong>34.</strong> Further, the personal information that we collect from you may also be used for the following purposes:</p>
