                            <p>Lyf is a new social media platform where users feel safe to share aspects of themselves previously deemed too personal for social media. Lyf users come from all walks of life and from many different backgrounds and cultures.
                                For this reason, we treat the conversations people have on lyf, and the beats they make, with the utmost respect. To protect the needs and interests of the wider community, we ask users to adhere to the following guidelines
                                while expressing themselves on lyf. Please read these guidelines carefully as they will help you to understand the type of content we deem acceptable, the type we consider inappropriate and the type which may be removed
                                or reported.</p>

                            <p>Lyf believes in the right for freedom of speech at all times. We encourage our users to express themselves without the fear of censorship. We believe that all opinions are equally valid and encourage users to challenge their
                                own views and the views of others.</p>
                        </div>

                            <p>Occasionally, on lyf, you may be exposed to an idea or approach to something that was previously unknown to you. Or perhaps it may be something you have considered before but discounted or even disagreed with. In any case,
                                just as in real life, we ask that all beat-makers be treated with respect.</p>

                            <p>At Lyf, we believe that in our social media lives we should be able to celebrate diversity of opinion the same way we would in our real lives: respectfully. So, if or when you read comments or views which do not resonate with
                                you, you have the option to click the disagree button which represents the idea of politely agreeing to disagree.</p>

                            <p>Lyf promotes and seeks to extend the frontiers of communication already opened up by the digital world. However, there is a limit to what will be accepted as appropriate and a limit to what will be tolerated. In the interests
                                of all users, please do not use lyf to upload content containing full nudity or sexual activity. Please also be aware that we have a strict policy which prohibits the sharing of pornographic content where a minor is involved.
                                Please do not engage in vitriolic, inflammatory language that hurts or antagonises people. Most of all we do not tolerate hate speech that is directed towards individuals or groups based on their race, religion, ethnicity,
                                sexual orientation, gender, disability, medical condition or age. Please also do not use lyf to create content that seeks to promote criminal activities or activities that are morally repugnant, for example, animal abuse,
                                bomb making, arson, or reckless driving. Whilst lyf encourages users to create content for the purposes of exploring personal struggles, lyf does not permit the use of its platform to plan or consider suicide or to promote
                                harm either to oneself or to others. If a user requires emergency assistance we recommend calling a local suicide prevention service. Beats created with the sole purpose of planning suicide will be removed without notice.</p>

                            <p>Lyf condemns any act of bullying on its platform. With this in mind, we give you, the user the power to immediately delete comments and/or posts which you deem to be inappropriate on your own beats. You also have the power
                                to immediately block select users should you deem it necessary. These measures should be sufficient in most cases however, please do not hesitate to report acts of bullying where these measures have been insufficient. We
                                take the safety of our users very seriously and, as such, promise to respond immediately when possible but always within 24 hours.<br> Lyf considers the act of posting defamatory content about another lyf user on one’s
                                own beat or creating a beat for the purpose of defaming or making fun of another user to be an act of bullying. Such content will be subject to removal without notice.</p>

                                of opinion will be considered to be an act of harassment. Please do not hesitate to report harassment. As with bullying, we promise to respond immediately when possible but always within 24 hours.</p>

                            <p>In the event you come across something you think violates our guidelines, it would be great if you could report it to us. This is done by tapping on the three dots, found for every post, beat, user and chat. Supplying us with
                                a reason and/or evidence goes a long way to accelerate the process.However, before doing so, please be sure to read over our guidelines again and consider getting a second opinion on the content before you contact us. Please
                                remember that reporting a piece of content you deem offensive, or which you feel may be out of keeping with our guidelines, does not automatically mean the content will be removed. You have the option to delete content
                                posted by others to your beats.<br/>To report abuse, you may also email <a href="mailto:community@lyfapp.com.au">community@lyfapp.com.au</a>. All reports of abuse of lyf’s Terms, Policies or Guidelines will be reviewed
                                by our mediators within 24 hours of the report being made, and further action will be taken based on each individual circumstance. Users who post content deemed to be offensive or in violation of lyf’s Terms, Policies or
